# JSON-Parser

JSON is a file format for exchanging hierarchical data between programs, often written in different programming languages and/or on different computers. In web programming, this allows a server application written in any language (e.g., Python or even C) to pass complex structures of information to the user's browser, which then renders it.

This program parses all types of C objects in JSON from integers, strings, lists, to objects using BSTs.
